SoundRTS is a real-time strategy audio game.

Feel free to experiment on the code base, but don't feel obliged to contribute back.

The license for the Python source code is a BSD 3-clause license (LICENSE.txt).
The license for the rest is unclear at the moment.

Running the game from the source (soundrts.py for the client, server.py for the standalone server) might require:
* Python 2.7
* Pygame 1.7.1 or later (Pygame 1.7.1 used to be the recommended version, but a later Pygame might work)
* win32com (if you use SAPI 5)

Building the binaries (with build-all.bat) might require:
* py2exe (Windows binary)
* Inno Setup 5 (Windows installer)
